Tightens the security of private posts by preventing clever users from obtaining unauthorized 
access to contained images and other attachments.

== Description ==

The 3rd-party Subscribe2 plugin allows registered and unregistered users to be notified via email whenever a new post is published.  
It allows users to subscribe to either full posts or excerpts of posts, to choose whether the format of full posts should be HTML 
or plain-text, and to select which categories they are interested in.

Subscribe2 was enhanced to work with Social Access Control so that users receive emails only for posts or categories of posts that 
they are permitted to view.  Also, the administrator can choose additional email content levels depending on whether the post is 
public or restricted: full post, excerpt, title only, no email.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `subcribe2-for-social-privacy` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click the "Setting" admin menu link, and select "Social Subscribe2".

4. Configure the options to taste, including the email template and any categories which should be excluded from notification
5. Click the "Manage" admin menu link, and select "Subscribers".
6. Manually subscribe people as you see fit.
7. Create a WordPress Page (http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages) to display the subscription form.  When creating the page, you may click the "S2" button on the QuickBar to automatically insert the subscribe2 token.  Or, if you prefer, you may manually insert the subscribe2 token:
     <!--subscribe2-->
     ***Ensure the token is on a line by itself and that it has a blank line above and below.***
This token will automatically be replaced by the subscription form, and will display all messages as necessary.
8. In the Social Subscribe2 "Options" admin link set the default page ID to the ID of the WordPress page created in step 7.
7. For other settings, please refer to the original readme file (readme-old.txt)
